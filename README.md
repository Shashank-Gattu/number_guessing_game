# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple yet engaging number guessing game where the player competes against the computer to guess a randomly selected number. The game features:

The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 10.

The player must input their guess in a text field.

After each guess, the game will tell the player whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

The player is given feedback on how many turns they've taken to guess correctly.

Upon correctly guessing the number, the game resets, and a new number is chosen for the player to guess.
